\begin{abstract}
We present a case study in combinatorial optimization applied to the chess piece placement problem: finding all valid non-attacking arrangements of 2 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Bishops, and 1 Knight on an $m \times n$ chessboard. Through systematic optimization across 6 distinct algorithmic approaches, we achieved significant performance improvements: from a baseline of 20-24 seconds for a 6$\times$6 board to 353ms (68$\times$ speedup), and successfully solved 7$\times$7 boards in 14.4 seconds---previously requiring 40+ minutes with brute force approaches. The key breakthrough was symmetry elimination using group theory, which reduced the 6$\times$6 solution space from 23,752 to 2,969 canonical forms while maintaining mathematical correctness. Our exploration of machine learning, MCTS, native compilation, GPU acceleration, and SAT solvers revealed fundamental limits of constraint satisfaction optimization. This work demonstrates both successful optimization techniques and valuable insights from systematic exploration of algorithmic dead ends.

\section{Introduction}

The chess piece placement problem belongs to the class of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) with exponential complexity. Given a set of chess pieces and an $m \times n$ board, the challenge is to find all valid arrangements where no piece attacks another. This problem generalizes the classic N-Queens puzzle but introduces heterogeneous piece types with distinct attack patterns, significantly increasing computational complexity.

Our investigation began with a baseline implementation that required 20-24 seconds for a 6$\times$6 board, with 7$\times$7 boards projected to take 40+ minutes due to exponential growth in the search space. Through systematic optimization and the application of algorithmic techniques including symmetry elimination, we achieved substantial performance improvements that significantly improved the computational feasibility of this problem class.

\section{Hardware Specifications}

All experiments were conducted on a system with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13620H (10 cores: 6P + 4E, 16 threads)
    \item Memory: 12GB RAM (WSL environment with access to 32GB physical RAM)
    \item GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 with 8GB VRAM
    \item OS: Linux (Ubuntu) on WSL2
    \item JVM: OpenJDK 21.0.8
    \item Scala Version: 2.12.19
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Protocol}

To ensure reproducibility, we applied the following protocol:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Processes pinned to physical cores, CPU governor set to \texttt{performance}
    \item JVM warm-up: 3 runs discarded before timing
    \item Reported results: median over $n=10$ runs with standard deviation
    \item Benchmarks associated with specific commit hashes in the git history
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Formalization}

\subsection{Mathematical Definition}

Let $B = \{(i,j) : 0 \leq i < m, 0 \leq j < n\}$ represent an $m \times n$ chessboard. Given a multiset of pieces $P = \{K^{n_K}, Q^{n_Q}, B^{n_B}, N^{n_N}, R^{n_R}\}$ where $K, Q, B, N, R$ represent King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, and Rook respectively, and $n_p$ denotes the count of piece type $p$.

A \textbf{valid placement} is a function $f: P \rightarrow B$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is injective (one piece per square)
\item $\forall p_i, p_j \in P$, piece $p_i$ does not attack piece $p_j$ according to chess rules
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Attack Pattern Formalization}

\begin{align}
A_K(s) &= \{(x \pm 1, y \pm 1), (x \pm 1, y), (x, y \pm 1)\} \cap B \\
A_Q(s, S) &= A_R(s, S) \cup A_B(s, S) \\
A_R(s, S) &= \text{ray-cast along rows/columns until first obstruction in } S \\
A_B(s, S) &= \text{ray-cast along diagonals until first obstruction in } S \\
A_N(s) &= \{(x \pm 2, y \pm 1), (x \pm 1, y \pm 2)\} \cap B
\end{align}

\textbf{Note:} Knights' attack sets do not depend on occupied squares. Ray-casting for sliding pieces stops at the first obstruction.

\section{Symmetry Elimination: Theoretical Foundation}

For square boards ($m = n$), the symmetry group is the dihedral group $D_4$ of order 8. For rectangular boards ($m \neq n$), the symmetry group reduces to $D_2$ of order 4 (identity, 180° rotation, horizontal and vertical reflections).

\section{Symmetry Integration}

Canonical form checking is applied at the \textbf{leaf level} (when all pieces are placed) to avoid premature pruning of distinct partial solutions:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
if (isLeaf(newDisposition, k = totalPieces)) {
  val canonical = canonicalForm(newDisposition)
  if (seenCanonical.putIfAbsent(canonical, true) == null) {
    results += newDisposition
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Experimental Validation}

\subsection{Correctness Verification}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
assert(originalSolutions.toSet == expandedSolutions.toSet)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Ablation Study}
