1. "App.scala" and "WebFrontEnd.scala": These two files share the Scala language dependency. They may also share common Scala libraries, functions, and variables. 

2. "application.conf": This file shares the configuration settings for the Scala application. It may include shared settings like server port, database connections, and other application-level configurations.

3. "index.html", "style.css", and "script.js": These files share the dependency of the web front end. They may share DOM element IDs, CSS classes, and JavaScript functions. The HTML file will contain the structure of the web page, the CSS file will contain the styles, and the JavaScript file will contain the functionality. 

4. "build.sbt": This file shares the build configuration for the Scala application. It may include shared dependencies like Scala version, library dependencies, and build settings.

5. "build.properties" and "plugins.sbt": These files share the project-level settings and plugins for the Scala application. They may include shared settings like SBT version, Scala compiler plugins, and other project-level configurations.

6. Shared Variables: Variables like server port, database connection strings, and application-level settings may be shared across multiple files.

7. Data Schemas: If the application is interacting with a database, the data schemas may be shared across multiple Scala files.

8. DOM Element IDs: The IDs of the DOM elements used in the "index.html" file will be shared with the "script.js" file for manipulating the DOM.

9. Message Names: If the application uses a messaging system, the message names may be shared across multiple Scala files.

10. Function Names: Functions defined in one Scala file may be used in another, so the function names may be shared.
