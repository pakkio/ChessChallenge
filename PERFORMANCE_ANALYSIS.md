- **Current Best**: 14.4 seconds (CarefulOptimizedSolver)
- **Solutions Found**: 382,990 canonical forms (complete solution set)
- **Improvement**: 68√ó speedup from original 20-24 second baseline

## Phase Analysis Summary

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Symmetry Elimination (SUCCESS)
**Achievement**: 68√ó performance improvement
- **Technique**: Group theory application to eliminate rotationally/reflectively equivalent boards
- **Implementation**: Canonical form computation with 8-way symmetry checking
- **Cache Optimization**: 15.8% hit rate on string canonicalization
- **Result**: 6√ó6 solved in 353ms, 7√ó7 in 14.4s

### ‚ùå Phase 2: Machine Learning Approaches (DEAD END)
**Conclusion**: "Non-ML CarefulOptimizedSolver wins"
- **Attempted**: Neural network placement predictors, reinforcement learning for piece ordering
- **Issues**: 
  - Training data generation complexity
  - Model inference overhead outweighs benefits
  - Constraint satisfaction better suited to deterministic approaches
- **Lesson**: Not all problems benefit from ML - combinatorial optimization can be inherently deterministic

### ‚ùå Phase 3: Monte Carlo Tree Search (DEAD END)
**Results**: Cannot maintain 90%+ solution coverage while beating 14.4s
- **Smart MCTS**: 246√ó faster (58ms) but only 1.7% solution coverage
- **Guided Exhaustive**: 100% coverage but 6√ó slower than baseline
- **Piece Ordering Optimization**: Destroyed cache efficiency (15.8% ‚Üí 0.5% hit rate)
- **Lesson**: Sampling approaches unsuitable when complete solution enumeration required

### ‚ùå Phase 4: GraalVM Native Compilation (DEAD END)
**Issues**: Scala/JVM complexity incompatible with native compilation
- **GraalVM Compatibility**: Severe runtime errors with method handles and parallel collections
- **Native Image Size**: 9.2MB executable created but non-functional
- **Simplified Version**: Performance degradation due to lost optimizations
- **Lesson**: Native compilation not universally beneficial for complex Scala applications

### ‚ùå Phase 5: GPU Computing (DEAD END)
**Issues**: CUDA complexity vs constraint satisfaction mismatch
- **JCuda Integration**: Complex JNI bindings between Scala and CUDA
- **Memory Transfer Overhead**: CPU‚ÜîGPU data transfer negates performance gains
- **Algorithm Mismatch**: Sequential constraint dependencies don't parallelize well
- **Development Complexity**: Weeks of low-level CUDA programming required
- **Lesson**: GPU acceleration unsuitable for cache-dependent constraint satisfaction

### ‚ùå Phase 6: SAT Solvers (DEAD END for Complete Enumeration)
**Results**: Excellent for single solutions, exponentially slow for complete enumeration
- **Single Solution Performance**: 0.42s vs 1.02s baseline (2.4√ó faster)
- **Complete Enumeration Failure**: 382,990 iterations with blocking clauses becomes exponentially slow
- **Root Cause**: SAT solvers optimized for satisfiability testing, not solution enumeration
- **Implementation**: Successfully created CNF encoding with 252 variables, 12,313+ clauses
- **Lesson**: SAT excels at "find one solution" but fails at "find all solutions"

## Performance Bottlenecks

### Current Limitations
1. **Exponential Search Space**: 7√ó7 creates ~10M+ Board objects vs 200K for 6√ó6
2. **Memory Allocation**: Object creation dominates runtime (2.5M+ instantiations for larger problems)
3. **Cache Dependencies**: Algorithm performance highly dependent on access patterns
4. **Sequential Processing**: Limited parallelization due to cache coherence requirements

### Hardware Constraints
- **CPU Bound**: Single-threaded constraint checking dominates
- **Memory Bound**: GC pressure from object allocation
- **Cache Sensitive**: Performance drops dramatically with poor cache locality
